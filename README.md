# Nearest-k-cars

The above code is a CPP code that returns 'k' nearest cars to the origin.

It uses HEAP Data Structure to implement the concept.

Few Points are given in form of arrays X and Y. Euclidean Distance is calculated for the purpose.

This is a basic implementation and can further be extended dynamically.
